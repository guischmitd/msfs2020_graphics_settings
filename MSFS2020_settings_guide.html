            <td>New TAA introduced with Update 5 has a larger performance impact - FXAA and DLAA seem to have some severe post processing / coloration issues  Geometry aliasing is visible in motion on Off, FXAA, and DLAA, which is not present in TAA. Running &lt;100 Render Scaling with TAA enabled reconstructs the image to native resolution, netting the performance impact that would come with a lower resolution but the image quality similar to a higher resolution.  I highly reccomend using TAA as it helps denoise Ambient Occlusion and Reflections.</td>
